# User Accounts

Users are the highest level resource in Losant. All applications and dashboards are either owned by a user or by an organization (of which users can be members). You can sign up as a new user on the <a href="https://accounts.losant.com/create-account" target="_blank">create account page</a>.

## User Profile

Your user profile stores information like your name and email address. To view and edit this information, click your name on the top right of the screen and select `Account Settings`. Once in the settings page, click the `User Profile` tab.

## Two-Factor Authentication

Losant's 2-factor authentication protects your account against unauthorized access even in the event your password has been compromised.

To use Losant's 2-factor authentication you must have a mobile/desktop application that supports the open [TOTP](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6238) standard. Google Authenticator is available for both [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.authenticator2 "Google Authenticator - Android") and [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/google-authenticator/id388497605?mt=8 "Google Authenticator - iOS"). Another excellent application for managing TOTP accounts is [Authy](https://www.authy.com/app/) which has both mobile and desktop clients.

### Enabling 2-Factor Authentication

Navigate to your `Account Settings` by clicking your name in the top right of the Losant application and selecting `Account Settings` in the dropdown. Then select the `Two Factor Auth` tab.

Use your favorite 2-factor authentication app like Google Authenticator to scan the QR code. The app will then start generating short-lived one-time use passwords. Type the current code generated in the app into the `Two-Factor Code` field in your Losant account settings. Enter your Losant password and click `Enable Two Factor Auth`.
