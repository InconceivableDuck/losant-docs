# What is Structure?

Structure is an easy-to-use and powerful developer platform designed to help you quickly and securely build complex connected solutions. Structure uses open communication standards like REST and MQTT to provide connectivity from one to millions of devices. Structure provides powerful data collection, aggregation, and visualization features to help understand and quantify vast amounts of sensor data. Structure's drag-and-drop workflow editor allows you to trigger actions, notifications, and machine-to-machine communication without programming.

## Device Connectivity

Structure provides device connectivity using open and industry standards like [MQTT](#) and [REST](#). This allows any custom device to connect to the Structure platform using tools and libraries available for almost any environment.

Structure provides open source SDKs for [Arduino](https://github.com/GetStructure/structure-sdk-js) and [Node.js](https://github.com/GetStructure/structure-sdk-js). This allows devices based on these technologies to quickly connect without requiring any additional implementation for the communication.

The two major communication mechanisms between devices and Structure are state and commands. State represents a snapshot of the device at some point in time. This is typically sensor data or some other periodic information the device generates. Devices will report state as often as needed, for example a device that reports temperature may report every few minutes.

Commands allow you to instruct your devices to take specific actions. What commands you support is entirely up to your device and its firmware. For example, if the device is a scrolling marquee, a command it might support is "update text" with a payload of `{ "text": "Welcome!" }`.

## Data Collection, Aggregation, Visualization

All state information reported by devices is stored. This allows you to visualize complex aggregations across one or more devices. For example, if you manufacture water quality sensors, Structure easily provides the ability to view, in real-time, the average water quality across all sensors, or view an average for a subset like a region or single building.

Structure's customizable dashboarding tools allow you to display and arrange information most important to your application.

## Workflows

Structure's drag-and-drop workflow editor allows you to easily build complex interactions between your devices and 3rd party systems.

// TODO: visualization

Workflows can be triggered by devices, timers, webhooks, and many other inputs. Outputs can be other devices, 3rd party systems, emails, sms, and many more. Structure's workflows provide a simple way connect your things together and move complex business logic off of your devices and into the cloud.
