# Losant Particle Builder Kit Instructions

The Losant Particle Builder Kit is a Particle-based version of the <a href="https://store.losant.com/products/losant-builder-kit" target="_blank">Losant Builder Kit</a> and an easy way to get up and running with the Losant IoT developer platform. This kit provides all the hardware and software needed to build a few simple projects that cover a wide variety of the features within the Losant platform.

As you perform these workshops, if you run into any issues, please refer to the [Losant Documentation](https://docs.losant.com) and the [Losant Forums](https://forums.losant.com) for help.

Your kit should include the following items:

* 1 Photon WiFi Development Kit that includes:
    * 1 Particle Photon
    * 2 resistors
    * 1 photoresistor
    * 1 LED
    * 1 solderless breadboard
    * 1 micro-USB cable
* 1 button
* 2 jump wires

## What We're Building

The widget we're building in this workshop includes a button, a light sensor (photoresistor), and an LED. The button is an addition to the default Particle development kit to extend its capabilities. We'll use the button to trigger actions in the virtual world, graph the value of the light sensor over time, and remotely control the LED from the web. This workshop is self-guided and provides detailed instructions, but feel free to explore other ways to use items. You have full access to the Losant platform to build anything you'd like.

## Build the Widget

Remove all the components from the Particle development kit box, remove the Photon from the breadboard, and build the widget as described below. If you're not familiar with how breadboards works, check out our [simple guide](https://www.losant.com/blog/how-to-use-a-breadboard). It might help make some of the wiring make sense.

![Wiring Diagram](/images/getting-started/losant-iot-dev-kits/builder-kit-particle/wiring-diagram.png "Wiring Diagram")

1. Push the Photons into terminals 1-12 on either side of the center line, which are rows “c” and “h.” The USB port should be facing away from the breadboard.
1. Connect the LED to terminals i12 (D0 on the Photon) and i15. Make sure the long wire is connected to i12.
1. Connect a resistor to terminals i4 (GND on the Photon) and i15. The orientation of the resistor doesn't matter.
1. Connect the photoresistor to terminals b8 (A4 on the Photon) and b12 (A0 on the Photon). The orientation doesn't matter.
1. Connect a resistor to terminals a2 (GND on the Photon) and a12 (A0 on the Photon). The orientation doesn't matter.
1. Connect the push button to terminals e19, e21, f19, and f21. It should straddle the center line of the breadboard.
1. Connect a jump wire between terminals j1 (3V3 on the Photon) and j19.
1. Connect a jump wire between terminals j11 (D1 on the Photon) and j21.

The finished widget should look like the below image.

// TODO take picture.

## Setup the Photon

Follows [these instructions](https://docs.particle.io/guide/getting-started/start/photon/#step-1-power-on-your-device) to create a Particle account properly connect the Photon to the WiFi network. It's likely that several Photons will show up in the list on your mobile device. In order to choose the correct one, you can find its ID on the back of your development kit box.

![Kit Box](/images/getting-started/losant-iot-dev-kits/builder-kit-particle/development-kit-box.jpg "Kit Box")

## Flash the Firmware

Once the Photon is properly configured, we can use Particle's cloud IDE to flash the workshop's firmware to the device. Navigate to [https://build.particle.io](https://build.particle.io) and create a new app. You can name it anything you want. Once created you'll see an empty file with setup and loop functions. It should look like the following image.

![Empty Sketch](/images/getting-started/losant-iot-dev-kits/builder-kit-particle/empty-sketch.png "Empty Sketch")

The sketch we need to upload to the Photon is available in GitHub. Open the file below and copy-paste the contents into the cloud IDE replacing all existing content.

[https://github.com/Losant/losant-kit-builder-particle/blob/master/workshop.ino](https://github.com/Losant/losant-kit-builder-particle/blob/master/workshop.ino)

Once pasted, flash the firmware to your device using the Flash button at the right-left corner of the screen.

![Flash Firmware](/images/getting-started/losant-iot-dev-kits/builder-kit-particle/flash-firmware.png "Flash Firmware")

The firmware we just flashed is publishing the value of the photoresistor to the Particle cloud every 5 seconds. It will also publish an event whenever the button is pressed. We can monitor these events using the Particle console. Navigate to [https://console.particle.io/logs](https://console.particle.io/logs) and you can see these events being published in real-time.

![Console Logs](/images/getting-started/losant-iot-dev-kits/builder-kit-particle/console-logs.png "Console Logs")

Now that we have data being published, it's time to integrate Losant so we can create dashboards and integrate the button event with external services.

## Losant Setup

If you haven't already, [sign up for Losant](https://accounts.losant.com/create-account). After signing up, create a new application for this workshop. You can name it anything you want.

![New Application](/images/getting-started/losant-iot-dev-kits/builder-kit-particle/new-application.png "New Application")

Next, add a device to the application to represent our Photon-powered widget.

![Add Device](/images/getting-started/losant-iot-dev-kits/builder-kit-particle/add-device.png "Add Device")

![Add Blank Device](/images/getting-started/losant-iot-dev-kits/builder-kit-particle/add-blank.png "Add Blank Device")

![Device Setup](/images/getting-started/losant-iot-dev-kits/builder-kit-particle/device-setup.png "Device Setup")

1. Set the device name to anything you want.
1. Set the device type to `Virtual`. This is required since the Photon won't be directly connecting to the Losant platform. The device's state information (light level and button presses) will be obtained by receiving webhooks from the Particle cloud, which we'll setup in a later step.
1. Set two attributes on the device: "light-level" and "button-pressed". Set both of their data types to `Number`.

Once everything is configured, click the `Create Device` button at the top-right on the screen.

Next, create a webhook that the Particle cloud can use to send published events to the Losant platform.

![Webhook Menu](/images/getting-started/losant-iot-dev-kits/builder-kit-particle/webhook-menu.png "Webhook Menu")

![Add Webhook](/images/getting-started/losant-iot-dev-kits/builder-kit-particle/add-webhook.png "Add Webhook")

![Webhook Settings](/images/getting-started/losant-iot-dev-kits/builder-kit-particle/webhook-settings.png "Webhook Settings")

1. Set the name of the webhook to anything you'd like.
1. Make sure `No Verification` is selected. Some services require webhooks to be verified in order for them to be invoked. Losant has built-in support for several of these. Particle does not require webhooks to be verified.

Click `Save Webhook` to create the webhook. The screen will now display the URL. Copy-paste this somewhere convenient because you'll need it in the next step.

![Webhook URL](/images/getting-started/losant-iot-dev-kits/builder-kit-particle/webhook-url.png "Webhook URL")

## Particle Integration Setup

Now that we have a webhook, we can give it to Particle so it will send Losant all of those events that are being published. Navigate to [https://console.particle.io/integrations](https://console.particle.io/integrations) and select `New Integration`.

![New Integration](/images/getting-started/losant-iot-dev-kits/builder-kit-particle/new-integration.png "New Integration")

Next, choose the Webhook integration.

![Webhook Integration](/images/getting-started/losant-iot-dev-kits/builder-kit-particle/webhook-integration.png "Webhook Integration")

The first webhook we'll create will be for the "light-level" event that is being published every five seconds by the Photon.

![Light Level Webhook](/images/getting-started/losant-iot-dev-kits/builder-kit-particle/light-level-webhook.png "Light Level Webhook")

1. Set the `Event Name` to "light-level".
1. Set the `URL` to the Webhook URL that was created in Losant.

Once complete, click the `Create Webhook` button. Now whenever the "light-level" event is published by the Photon, Particle will invoke that webhook and send the data to Losant where it can be stored and displayed on a dashboard.

Repeat the same process again and create a webhook integration for the "button-pressed" event. Use the same webhook URL.

![Button Webhook](/images/getting-started/losant-iot-dev-kits/builder-kit-particle/button-webhook.png "Button Webhook")

Your integrations page should now look something like the below image.

![Integrations](/images/getting-started/losant-iot-dev-kits/builder-kit-particle/integrations.png "Integrations")

At this point, all event data is now being published to Particle and then sent to Losant. Now let's populate our Losant device and start building a dashboard with data.

## Device Data and Dashboards

Particle is pushing event data to Losant using your webhook. We need to catch those webhooks and send that data into the Losant device we created earlier. Fortunately this is very easy to do using a [Losant Workflow](https://docs.losant.com/workflows/overview/).

First, create a new workflow and name it anything you'd like.

![Create Workflow](/images/getting-started/losant-iot-dev-kits/builder-kit-particle/create-workflow.png "Create Workflow")

![Workflow Settings](/images/getting-started/losant-iot-dev-kits/builder-kit-particle/workflow-settings.png "Workflow Settings")

![Empty Workflow](/images/getting-started/losant-iot-dev-kits/builder-kit-particle/empty-workflow.png "Empty Workflow")

At this point, you have an empty workflow. The first thing we need to do is trigger with workflow with the webhook being invoked by Particle. Start by dragging a [Webhook trigger](https://docs.losant.com/workflows/triggers/webhook/) onto the workflow canvas.

![Workflow Webhook](/images/getting-started/losant-iot-dev-kits/builder-kit-particle/workflow-webhook.png "Workflow Webhook")

Next, let's connect a [Debug node](https://docs.losant.com/workflows/outputs/debug/) so you can see what a workflow payload look like. Every workflow is invoked by a trigger which includes a payload. In our example, the trigger is the webhook and the payload is whatever Particle sent us. As workflows execute, the payload flows through the nodes. Nodes can modify and make decisions based on the payload as needed. The debug node simply logs the payload to the debug tab.

Drag a debug node to the canvas and connect it to the webhook node.

![Workflow Debug](/images/getting-started/losant-iot-dev-kits/builder-kit-particle/workflow-debug.png "Workflow Debug")

We're now ready to deploy this workflow. Click the `Deploy Workflow` button on the top-right.

![Deploy Workflow](/images/getting-started/losant-iot-dev-kits/builder-kit-particle/deploy-workflow.png "Deploy Workflow")

Once it's deployed, select the Debug tab on the bottom-right. The Photon is publishing the "light-level" event every five seconds, so we should see a debug message each time Particle sends that event to Losant.

![Debug Output](/images/getting-started/losant-iot-dev-kits/builder-kit-particle/debug-output.png "Debug Output")

All triggers place their information on the `data` field of the payload. The webhook trigger places lots of useful information about the underlying request, but the important information is available on `data.body`, which contains the "light-level" event name and value. If you were to push the button, you'd see a debug message that contained the event name "button-pressed".

```json
{
  "data": {
    "body": {
      "event": "light-level",
      "data": "129",
      "published_at": "2016-08-03T21:56:39.633Z",
      "coreid": "410027000247353138383138"
    }
  }
}
```

Now that we have data coming from Particle and into Losant, it's time to send it to the device we created earlier. The first thing we need to do it branch the workflow using a [Conditional](https://docs.losant.com/workflows/logic/conditional/) node based on the event that Particle sends.
