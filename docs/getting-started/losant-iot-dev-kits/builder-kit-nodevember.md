## Overview

These instructions are split into three workshops. Each workshop builds on the previous one and adds new functionality to your kit. It is recommended that you complete the workshops in order.

## Environment Setup

The microcontroller included in this kit is configured using the Arduino tools. In this workshop, you will not have to do any programming. We will configure the device using the <a href="https://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/Serial" target="_blank">Arduino IDE's serial monitor</a>. Also, we will need to install USB drivers to communicate with the microcontroller.

### Install Arduino IDE
Download and install the latest version of the Arduino IDE by following the instructions at:<br />
<a href="https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software" target="_blank">https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software</a>

### Install USB Drivers

The microcontroller boards requires a USB to UART driver that must be installed for programming. Download and install the driver for your platform by following the instructions at:

<a href="https://www.silabs.com/products/mcu/Pages/USBtoUARTBridgeVCPDrivers.aspx" target="_blank">https://www.silabs.com/products/mcu/Pages/USBtoUARTBridgeVCPDrivers.aspx</a>

![Mac Driver Disk Image](/images/getting-started/losant-iot-dev-kits/environment-setup/mac-driver-disk-image.png "Mac Driver Disk Image")

## Workshop 1 – Internet Button

The first workshop creates an Internet button that triggers a Losant Workflow to send yourself an email.

### Wiring

***Disconnect the NodeMCU dev kit from USB.***

For this workshop, you’ll need to attach the NodeMCU and button to the breadboard. Below is the wiring diagram. For more information on what breadboards are and how they work, check out our blog post on <a href="https://www.losant.com/blog/how-to-use-a-breadboard" target="\_blank">How to Use a Breadboard</a>.

![Workshop 1 Wiring Diagram](/images/getting-started/losant-iot-dev-kits/builder-kit-nodemcu/workshop-1-wiring-diagram.png "Workshop 1 Wiring Diagram")

1. Push the NodeMCU into terminals 1-15 on either side of the center line, which are rows “b” and “i.” The USB port should be facing away from the breadboard.
1. Connect the 3V3 pin from the NodeMCU (a1) to the positive rail with a jump wire.
1. Connect the GND pin from the NodeMCU (a2) to the negative rail with a jump wire.
1. Connect the button to the other end of the breadboard so its leads straddle the center line and connect it to terminals e28, e30, f28, and f30.
1. Connect the positive rail to the button using terminal a28 using a jump wire.
1. Connect the negative rail to the button using terminal c30 using a resistor. It doesn’t matter which way resistors are oriented.
1. Connect the pin labeled "D1" on the NodeMCU (a14) to the button (j30) with a jump wire. In our code, "D1" is the equivalent of GPIO pin 5.

![Workshop 1 Wiring Image](/images/getting-started/losant-iot-dev-kits/builder-kit-nodemcu/workshop-1-wiring-image.jpg "Workshop 1 Wiring Image")

## Losant Setup

In this section, you’ll register for a Losant account, create your application, and add the device for your builder kit.

### Create Account

If you don't already have an account, navigate to [https://accounts.losant.com/create-account](https://accounts.losant.com/create-account) to register.

### Create Application

Create an application for the builder kit. You can name it whatever you want.

![Create Application](/images/getting-started/losant-iot-dev-kits/builder-kit/create-application.png "Create Application")

![Application Settings](/images/getting-started/losant-iot-dev-kits/builder-kit/application-settings.png "Application Settings")

### Add Device

The next step is to register the builder kit device with the platform. Click the `Add Device` button on the top right or select `Add Device` from the Devices dropdown.

![Add Device Menu](/images/getting-started/losant-iot-dev-kits/builder-kit/add-device-menu.png "Add Device Menu")

Next, choose the `Create from Scratch` option.

![Create From Scratch](/images/getting-started/losant-iot-dev-kits/moisture-sensor/add-from-scratch.png "Create From Scratch")

![Add Device Name](/images/getting-started/losant-iot-dev-kits/builder-kit/add-device-name.png "Add Device Name")

![Add Device Attributes](/images/getting-started/losant-iot-dev-kits/builder-kit/add-device-attributes.png "Add Device Attributes")

1. Name the device anything you want.
1. "Description" can be left blank, or fill it with whatever you want.
1. For "Device Type", leave "Standalone" selected.
1. No device tags are required.
1. Add the following under "Device Attributes":
    1. button: boolean
    1. tempC: number
    1. tempF: number

The device attributes specify what state information the device reports. The firmware that you’ll flash in the following sections will report whenever a button is pressed, the temperature in Celsius (tempC), and the temperature in Fahrenheit (tempF). Device attributes are ***case-sensitive***, so make sure to enter these ***exactly as they appear***.

Click the `Create Device` button. The screen will change and show the device’s ID. This ID is required for the following sections. You might want to copy/paste it somewhere convenient.

![Device ID](/images/getting-started/losant-iot-dev-kits/builder-kit/device-id.png "Device ID")

### Generate Security Tokens

Now we need to generate some security tokens so your device can authenticate against the Losant platform. Select `More > Access Keys` from the application menu.

![Access Keys](/images/getting-started/losant-iot-dev-kits/builder-kit/access-keys.png "Access Keys")

For these workshops, generate an access key that provides access to all devices in your application.

![Token Restrictions](/images/getting-started/losant-iot-dev-kits/builder-kit/token-restrictions.png "Token Restrictions")

This will cause a popup to appear with your access tokens. Losant ***DOES NOT*** store the secret, so you’ll have to copy it somewhere secure. Both of these values will be needed in the following sections, so make sure you copy/paste them somewhere convenient.

![Access Token Popup](/images/getting-started/losant-iot-dev-kits/builder-kit/access-token-popup.png "Access Token Popup")

### Configure Device

Now that you have a device configured in Losant, we can configure our internet button to connect to WiFI and Losant. In this workshop, we have already pre-configured the device to accept JSON commands via Serial. Serial is just a communication protocol that allows us to send and receive information from a device. Generally, serial output is used as a simple logging mechanism. The JSON command to configure this device looks like the following:

```
{
  "losant-config-wifi-ssid": "<Wifi SSID>",
  "losant-config-wifi-pass": "<Wifi Password>",
  "losant-config-device-id": "<Losant Device ID>",
  "losant-config-access-key": "<Losant Access Key>",
  "losant-config-access-secret": "<Losant Access Secret>",
  "losant-config-tmp": false
}
```

Copy/paste this JSON to a safe place and update the values. `losant-config-tmp` should be kept false, it is used later in the workshop.

If interested, this builder kit has another set of <a href="https://docs.losant.com/getting-started/losant-iot-dev-kits/builder-kit/" target="_blank">instructions</a>. The environment setup is longer, but you will be able to rewrite and re-flash the device yourself.

### Update Serial Port

Now, let's open up the Arduino IDE and setup our device. First, you
will need to update Arduino's serial port. The Arduino IDE needs to know which USB device to communicate with.  Make sure the device shows up under the Arduino IDE's `Tools -> Port` menu and it's selected. If it is not there, check to make sure you have installed the <a href="https://www.silabs.com/products/mcu/Pages/USBtoUARTBridgeVCPDrivers.aspx" target="_blank">USB drivers</a>.

![Update Serial Port](/images/getting-started/losant-iot-dev-kits/builder-kit-nodevember/serial-uart.png "Update Serial Port")

To send commands to the device, open the Arduino IDE's Serial Monitor and change the baud rate to 9600. The serial monitor can be opened using the button on the top right of the Arduino IDE or using the `Tools -> Serial Monitor` menu.

![Open Serial Monitor](/images/getting-started/losant-iot-dev-kits/builder-kit/open-serial-button.png "Open Serial Monitor")

![Serial Monitor Baud](/images/getting-started/losant-iot-dev-kits/builder-kit-nodevember/serial-monitor-baud.png "Serial Monitor Baud")

The serial monitor won't print any information until we reset the device. **Since the device is pre-flashed with firmware Losant created for this workshop, we will need to hit `RST` on the device to initialize the serial connection to Arduino.**

![Reset NodeMcu](/images/getting-started/losant-iot-dev-kits/builder-kit-nodevember/reset-node-mcu.jpg "Reset NodeMcu")

After the reset is complete, the Serial Monitor should start printing information:

![Serial Start](/images/getting-started/losant-iot-dev-kits/builder-kit-nodevember/serial-start.png "Serial Start")

Once you see the intro message, you are now able to configure the device. Copy your JSON command with the updated values and paste it into the top input bar of the serial monitor. This will send the JSON to the device.

The firmware running on the device knows how to <a href="https://github.com/Losant/losant-kit-builder-nodevember" target="_blank">parse JSON</a> and update the respective values. This new configuration will be saved in the device's local memory so that the config persists when you unplug or restart your device.

![Json Serial Input](/images/getting-started/losant-iot-dev-kits/builder-kit-nodevember/json-serial-input.png "Json Serial Input")

After the upload is complete, the Serial Monitor should start printing information about it connecting to WiFi and Losant. Push the button you wired up in the breadboard, and the Serial Monitor will print “Button Pressed!”

![Serial Output](/images/getting-started/losant-iot-dev-kits/builder-kit-nodevember/serial-output.png "Serial Output")

If you don’t see the “Button Pressed!” message, check your wiring. The jump wires are not always the best connectors and sometimes just need to be wiggled around a little.

Every time the button is pressed, the firmware is publishing the state `{ "button": true }` to Losant. Currently, this firmware only reports when the button goes to true, it does not report the button going back to false. So if you hold the button down for a long time, it will only report when the button is initially pressed.

In come cases, it may be helpful to reset the device. There is a JSON command called `losant-config-clear` that will wipe the configuration to it's initial state.

```
{ "losant-config-clear" : true }
```

It’s now time to go into Losant and make use of this data.

### Create Workflow

[Workflows](https://docs.losant.com/workflows/overview/) in Losant allow you to easily perform actions based on various triggers. In this workshop, our trigger will be a device state. Whenever the button is pressed, the device publishes a state message to Losant that we can use to trigger an action – for example, sending an email.

Create a new workflow and name it “Internet Button.”

![Create Workflow](/images/getting-started/losant-iot-dev-kits/builder-kit/create-workflow.png "Create Workflow")

![Save Workflow](/images/getting-started/losant-iot-dev-kits/builder-kit/save-workflow.png "Save Workflow")

Start by dragging a Device workflow trigger node to the canvas. Then, on the Device trigger's configuration panel, select your builder kit device. Since this is likely the application's only device, it will be selected by default. If, however, you have more than one device, simply start typing the name of the device and select it from the dropdown.

![Device Workflow Node](/images/getting-started/losant-iot-dev-kits/builder-kit/device-workflow-node.png "Device Workflow Node")

Next, add a [Debug node](https://docs.losant.com/workflows/outputs/debug/) so you can test that the workflow is triggered when the button is pressed. This is also an opportunity to see what a workflow payload looks like. Understanding the payload will help make the following steps make sense.

![Debug Workflow Node](/images/getting-started/losant-iot-dev-kits/builder-kit/debug-workflow-node.png "Debug Workflow Node")

Workflow nodes are connected by clicking on the small diamond-shaped connector on the source node and dragging it to anywhere on the destination node.

This workflow is now ready to test. Deploy it using the `Deploy Workflow` button on the top right.

![Deploy Workflow Button](/images/getting-started/losant-iot-dev-kits/builder-kit/deploy-workflow-button.png "Deploy Workflow Button")

After the workflow has been deployed, you can press the device button to see the debug output. The debug output can be reached by clicking the `Debug` tab on the bottom right of the screen.

![Debug Output](/images/getting-started/losant-iot-dev-kits/builder-kit/debug-output.png "Debug Output")

What the Debug node outputs is what Losant calls a “workflow payload.” This is the data that flows through the workflow. Workflow nodes can change the payload, validate values, and perform many other operations. In this example, the payload includes the state that was published.

```text
{ "data" : { "button" : true }}
```

If you have an empty data field that does not include the button value, the typical cause is the button attribute defined on the device does not exactly match "button" (all lowercase). Go back to your device page and double-check that it matches exactly. If it does not, simply change the attribute's name and save the device. The button field should then automatically start showing up.

You may remember that when you originally set up the device, we added an attribute named “button” whose data type was boolean. This is the attribute that the firmware we flashed is sending to Losant. There’s nothing special about the name “button”; we could have named it anything.

Since the Device node can be triggered on any state request and we only want this workflow to run when the button attribute is sent, let’s add a [Conditional node](https://docs.losant.com/workflows/logic/conditional/) to check that the value of button is true. This will be important for the later workshops when the device starts sending other state information. We don’t want an email every time the device sends something.

![Conditional Workflow Node](/images/getting-started/losant-iot-dev-kits/builder-kit/conditional-workflow-node.png "Conditional Workflow Node")

You can delete the existing Debug node or click on the connecting line and delete it. Either way, insert a Conditional node between the Device node and the Debug node.

Many workflow nodes, including the Conditional node, support what Losant calls [expressions](/workflows/accessing-payload-data/#expressions), which allow for testing the truthiness of a condition against a payload property. Set the conditional expression to the following:

```text
{{ data.button }} == true
```

This expression pulls the value of data.button from the payload, which you saw earlier using the debug node. If data.button doesn’t exist, this will evaluate to false.

The Conditional node branches the workflow depending on whether the expression is true or false. If the value is true, the workflow takes the right branch. If the expression is false, the workflow takes the left branch. Since we have nothing attached to the false branch, the workflow simply ends and nothing happens.

The last step is to add the Email node to send yourself an email every time the button is pressed.

![Email Workflow Node](/images/getting-started/losant-iot-dev-kits/builder-kit/email-workflow-node.png "Email Workflow Node")

Losant has two email output nodes. The [Email](https://docs.losant.com/workflows/outputs/email/) node sends emails using Losant’s servers, but has a limit of one email per minute. If you need to send more than that, you can use the [Sendgrid](https://docs.losant.com/workflows/outputs/sendgrid/) email node.

Enter your email address as a recipient. You can then specify any subject and body you’d like. All of these fields support templates, which means they could pull their values from the payload, but this doesn’t apply for our example. For now, simply type any text you'd like.

Click the “Deploy Workflow” button and press the hardware button. You should now receive an email with the subject and body you specified.

This completes the first workshop. You’ve successfully created an Internet button that can be used for any number of useful actions. For an extra challenge, try browsing the other output nodes and come up with other actions you can control with your Internet button, such as sending yourself a text message.

## Bonus Workshop - Virtual Light Wall

If you visit [http://lights.mod.bz](http://lights.mod.bz) you'll see a 3x3 grid of squares - that's the "Virtual Light Wall". In this workshop, we're going to make one of those squares light up with a random color and display a message of your choosing whenever you hit your internet button.

Start by adding an HTTP node to your workflow and connecting it to the Conditional node. You may also want to disconnect the Email node so you don't get emails every time you press the button during this workshop.

![HTTP Workflow Node](/images/getting-started/losant-iot-dev-kits/builder-kit-nodemcu/workflow-http-node.png "HTTP Workflow Node")

On the HTTP node configuration properties, change the `Request Method` to `POST` and set the `URL Template` to "http://lights.mod.bz".

Set the body template to the following:

```json
{ "name" : "your name here", "message" : "your message here" }
```

The name and message can be anything you want. Try to keep it family friendly because it will be displayed in front of everyone.

Lastly, add a request header by setting the `Name` to "content-type" and the `Value Template` to "application/json".

Click the `Deploy Workflow` button to deploy this workflow. Now whenever you press the internet button, this workflow is making a request to the Light Wall website that includes your name and message. The Light Wall then lights up a random square and displays the information. Everyone else who is also viewing the Virtual Light Wall will see your message in real-time.

This workshop shows a lot of the power behind workflows. We've completely changed the behavior of our internet button without having to write any code or update the firmware running on the device itself.

## Workshop 2 – Remote Control LED

In the previous workshop, we showed you how to make a physical button do something in the virtual world. In this example, we’re going show how a virtual button can do something in the physical world.

Losant supports two major communication mechanisms – [states](https://docs.losant.com/devices/state/) and [commands](https://docs.losant.com/devices/commands/). You already saw how state works in the previous example. Commands allow you to send actions to the device. In this workshop, we’re going to send a “toggle” command that will turn on and off an LED.

### Wiring

***Disconnect the NodeMCU from USB.***

Each workshop builds on the previous one, so if you completed the first workshop, it is not necessary to disconnect any components from your breadboard. We will simply add an LED and connect it to the NodeMCU.

![Workshop 2 Wiring Diagram](/images/getting-started/losant-iot-dev-kits/builder-kit-nodemcu/workshop-2-wiring-diagram.png "Workshop 2 Wiring Diagram")


1. Add the LED so the positive lead (the longer one) is in terminal c19 and the negative lead is in c20.
1. Connect the positive lead of the LED to D2 on the NodeMCU (terminal a13) with a jump wire.
1. Connect the negative lead of the LED from terminal c20 to the negative rail with a resistor.

![Workshop 2 Wiring Image](/images/getting-started/losant-iot-dev-kits/builder-kit-nodemcu/workshop-2-wiring-image.jpg "Workshop 2 Wiring Image")

### Create the Virtual Button

Create a new workflow and name it “Virtual Button.”

![Create Workflow Virtual Button](/images/getting-started/losant-iot-dev-kits/builder-kit/create-workflow-virtual-button.png "Create Workflow Virtual Button")

![Workflow Virtual Button Settings](/images/getting-started/losant-iot-dev-kits/builder-kit/workflow-virtual-button-settings.png "Create Workflow Virtual Button")

Once created, drag the Virtual Button workflow node to the canvas.

![Virtual Button Workflow Node](/images/getting-started/losant-iot-dev-kits/builder-kit/virtual-button-workflow-node.png "Virtual Button Workflow Node")

The Virtual Button node allows you to completely define the payload that will flow through the workflow. Since we won’t be using the payload, it can be kept as an empty object or left blank. The Virtual Button is often useful to debug complex workflows because you can trigger the workflow with any test data you’d like, but in our case, we're going to use it to send the toggle command to our device.

Next, drag a Device Command node onto the canvas and connect it to the Virtual Button.

![Device Command Workflow Node](/images/getting-started/losant-iot-dev-kits/builder-kit/device-command-workflow-node.png "Device Command Workflow Node")

The Device Command node requires the device and the command details. Since you likely only have one device, it should be automatically selected. If not, choose it from the dropdown. The command name that the kit supports is “toggle.” Command names can be anything, and what commands a device supports are entirely up to the firmware. In our example, the firmware we flashed is looking for a command named “toggle” and knows to flip the LED when it’s received. Commands also support optional payloads that could be arguments to the command. For example, if the command is “start recording,” the payload could be `{ "resolution" : 1080 }`. Our toggle command, however, doesn't need a payload, so leave it blank.

Click the “Deploy Workflow” button at the top-right of the screen.

![Deploy Virtual Button](/images/getting-started/losant-iot-dev-kits/builder-kit/deploy-virtual-button.png "Deploy Virtual Button")

Once deployed, you can now click the virtual button and see the LED on the board turn on and off.

![Virtual Button Click](/images/getting-started/losant-iot-dev-kits/builder-kit/virtual-button-click.png "Virtual Button Click")

The Serial Monitor will also print a message whenever a command is received.

![Command Serial Output](/images/getting-started/losant-iot-dev-kits/builder-kit/command-serial-output.png "Command Serial Output")

We’ve now seen the two primary ways devices can communicate with Losant – state and commands. If you link these together, a whole world of possibilities opens up. Imagine having two builder kits where the button on one invokes the toggle command on another via a workflow. This allows us to easily perform machine-to-machine (m2m) communication without the devices even knowing about each other.

## Workshop 3 – Temperature Sensor

In this workshop, we’re going to add a temperature sensor to your builder kit. We’ll then use Losant’s dashboarding tools to visualize the real-time and historical temperature data.

### Wiring

***Disconnect the NodeMCU from USB.***

Just like the previous workshop, keep everything you've already wired and add these new components.

![Workshop 3 Wiring Diagram](/images/getting-started/losant-iot-dev-kits/builder-kit-nodemcu/workshop-3-wiring-diagram.png "Workshop 3 Wiring Diagram")


1. Add the tmp36 temperature sensor to terminals e22, e23, and e24. It’s ***VERY IMPORTANT*** that the sensor is oriented the right way with the flat side facing the bottom of the board – towards column a.
1. Connect the rightmost lead (a24) of the temperature sensor to the negative rail using a jump wire.
1. Connect the leftmost lead (a22) of the temperature sensor to the positive rail using a jump wire.
1. Connect the center lead (a23) to the A0 pin on the NodeMCU (terminal j15) with a jump wire.

![Workshop 3 Wiring Image](/images/getting-started/losant-iot-dev-kits/builder-kit-nodemcu/workshop-3-wiring-image.jpg "Workshop 3 Wiring Image")

### Update Configuration

Plug the NodeMCU back into USB. You may have noticed that there was a configuration parameter called `losant-config-tmp` set to false. To start monitoring temperature, we will need to set this to true. All this config is doing is deciding whether to read from the microcontroller analog pin, which the temperature sensor is connected.

To update config, send this command to the device via serial:

```
{ "losant-config-tmp" : true }
```

After the upload completes, the Serial Monitor will print the temperature every 15 seconds.

![Temp Serial Output](/images/getting-started/losant-iot-dev-kits/builder-kit-nodevember/temp-serial-output.png "Temp Serial Output")

This firmware is publishing state every 15 seconds to the Losant platform. The state includes the tempF and tempC attributes that we defined back when the device was added. This is also why we had to add the Conditional Workflow node to the Internet button (Workshop 1). Without the Conditional, you’d get an email every time the device published temperature, which is likely not what you want.

### Build a Dashboard

Now, let’s visualize some of this temperature data that we’re sending. Create a new dashboard in Losant and add a gauge block.

![Create Dashboard](/images/getting-started/losant-iot-dev-kits/builder-kit/create-dashboard.png "Create Dashboard")

![Create Dashboard Form](/images/getting-started/losant-iot-dev-kits/builder-kit/create-dashboard-form.png "Create Dashboard Form")

![Add Gauge](/images/getting-started/losant-iot-dev-kits/builder-kit/add-gauge.png "Add Gauge")

The gauge block allows you to display a single real-time value or a value that is an aggregate over time (like sum, mean, etc).

![Gauge Details](/images/getting-started/losant-iot-dev-kits/builder-kit/gauge-details.png "Gauge Details")

Set the gauge block header to any value you’d like. Select your builder kit application from the Application dropdown. Change the Block Type to `Dial Gauge` and set the minimum to 0 and the maximum to 100. We want to show the real-time temperature, so select `Last received data point` from the Duration dropdown. Lastly, enter units (Deg F) in the label field, select your device, and set the attribute to either "tempF" or "tempC," whichever you’re more familiar with.

As soon as you enter all values, you should see the preview on the right immediately update.

Once you click `Add Block`, the gauge will appear on your dashboard.

![Dashboard with Gauge](/images/getting-started/losant-iot-dev-kits/builder-kit/dashboard-with-gauge.png "Dashboard with Gauge")

Next, let’s add a graph to the dashboard that shows the temperature value over time. Click the `Add Block` link on the top-right and select the `Time Series Graph` block.

![Select Linear Graph](/images/getting-started/losant-iot-dev-kits/builder-kit/select-linear-graph.png "Select Linear Graph")

![Time Series Settings](/images/getting-started/losant-iot-dev-kits/builder-kit/time-series-settings.png "Time Series Settings")

Set the name of the block to any value you’d like. Select your builder kit application from the Application drop down. Next, select to view the last 15 minutes of data at a 10 second resolution. This will cause the graph to show 15 minutes of data with a data point every 10 seconds.

In the block data section, name the graph series Deg F or Deg C, select your device, select the tempF or tempC attribute, and set the aggregation to `MEAN`.
