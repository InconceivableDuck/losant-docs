## Overview

The device we're building in this workshop contains a button and an LED. When the button is pressed, a <a href="https://help.salesforce.com/apex/HTViewHelpDoc?id=cases_home.htm&language=en_US" target="_blank">Salesforce Case</a> will be created. The LED will be controlled by the number of open cases. If there are any open cases, the LED will be lit. If there are no open cases, the LED will be off. This device provides a quick way to create new cases and an easy way to visualize whether or not there are open cases that need to be addressed.

## Wiring

// TODO: combine the button and led wiring instructions into one step.

## How to get Salesforce Security Token

In order to integrate with Salesforce, we're going to need a security token. You can get this through your account settings. First, click your account icon in the top-right corner and select "Settings".

Next, in the Quick Search field on the left, type "Reset" to find the option to reset your token.

Lastly, click the "Reset Security Token" button.

Once complete, Salesforce will send you the security token via email. This token will be used in later steps to invoke the Salesforce API to create cases when the button is pressed.
