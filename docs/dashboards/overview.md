# Dashboards

Losant dashboards provide a flexible and powerful way to display information relevant to your specific connected solution. Users can have many different dashboards and a single dashboard can display information from many different applications and devices.

## Adding Blocks

Losant supports many different blocks for visualizing various pieces of information. New blocks can be added to your dashboard by clicking the `Add Block` link at the top of the dashboard.

## Auto Refreshing

Dashboards by default will automatically refresh the data every 60 seconds. You can pause the refreshing at any time by clicking the pause button at the top of the dashboard. You can also force the dashboard to refresh by clicking the refresh button.  You can also control the refresh interval under the settings for the dashboard.

## Dashboard Access Control

Dashboards have a three levels of access - private, password protected, and public.  Private
means that only you (or members of your organization, if it is an organization-owned
dashboard) can see the dashboard.  Public dashboards can be seen by anyone who has the
dashboard url, regardless of whether that person is logged in to a Losant account. This is great for sharing public data, but remember that any data exposed in a public dashboard is *public* and is accessible by anyone. Do not make your dashboard public if it contains any private or sensitive data. The third level of access is in between public and private -
you can add a password to your dashboard, and allow anyone with the url and the password
to view the dashboard.  This adds some protection to your dashboard, while still making it
easy to share with people who do not have Losant accounts. You can manage the access control for a dashboard on the settings page for the dashboard:

## Embedding Dashboard Blocks into Other Sites

If your dashboard has been set to `public`, you may embed any of your dashboard blocks into a third-party site. To get an embed code, hover over your dashboard block and click the `<>` icon in the block header.

This will display a modal where you can set the block's `width`, `height` and `theme` properties. For your width and height, make sure to enter a valid CSS length attribute (`%`, `px`, `em`, `vw`, etc.).

NOTE: The following blocks will not display any data on public dashboards or to non-authorized users when embedded:

*   `Application List`
*   `Input Controls`

## Templating

A number of the dashboard blocks allow templating of various output, for greater control over how data is displayed.  Templates are rendered through the [Handlebars templating language](http://handlebarsjs.com/), and in most cases (but not all) the result is treated as [Markdown](http://commonmark.org/help/) for display.  Handlebars has a number of [built in](http://handlebarsjs.com/builtin_helpers.html) helpers, but Losant provides a number of extra ones to make complex templating much easier:

*   `eq` - If a value is equal to some number or string.  
For example: `{{#eq value 100}}Value is 100{{else}}Value is not 100{{/eq}}`  
<br/>
*   `ne` - If a value is not equal to some number or string.  
For example: `{{#ne value 100}}Value is not 100{{else}}Value is 100{{/ne}}`  
<br/>
*   `gt`, `gte` - If a value is greater than (or equal to) some number.  
For example: `{{#gt value 100}}Bigger than 100{{else}}Not bigger than 100{{/gt}}`  
<br/>
*   `lt`, `lte` - If a value is less than (or equal to) some number.  
For example: `{{#lt value 100}}Smaller than 100{{else}}Not smaller than 100{{/lt}}`  
<br/>
*   `match` - If a value matches a given regexp or string.  
For example: `{{#match value "hello"}}Has hello{{else}}Does not have hello{{/match}}`  
<br/>
*   `format` - Formats a number or date using [d3](https://github.com/d3/d3-format) or [moment](http://momentjs.com/docs/#/displaying/format/) syntax, or JSON stringify objects or arrays. The second argument is optional - if not passed, default formatting will be used.  
For example: `{{format value "0.1f"}}` or `{{format value}}`  
<br/>
*   `lower` - Transforms a string to all lowercase.  
For example: `{{lower value}}`  
<br/>
*   `upper` - Transforms a string to all uppercase.  
For example: `{{upper value}}`  
<br/>
*   `encodeURI` - Transforms a string through the [encodeURI](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/encodeURI) function.  
For example: `{{encodeURI value}}`  
<br/>
*   `decodeURI` - Transforms a string through the [decodeURI](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/decodeURI) function.  
For example: `{{decodeURI value}}`  
<br/>
*   `encodeURIComponent` - Transforms a string through the [encodeURIComponent](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/encodeURIComponent) function.  
For example: `{{encodeURIComponent value}}`  
<br/>
*   `decodeURIComponent` - Transforms a string through the [decodeURIComponent](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/decodeURIComponent) function.  
For example: `{{decodeURIComponent value}}`
