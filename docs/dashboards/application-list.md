# Application List

The Application List block allows you to display a list of your applications on your dashboard. The list includes links to the applications, their names, and their workflow and device count.

## Configuration

The block takes one optional parameter: a filter to reduce the list of applications by name. The filter only checks against the beginning of the application name (e.g. filtering with "Th" will display an application called "Thermostat" but hide one called "Monolith"). To display all of your applications, do not provide an application filter.
