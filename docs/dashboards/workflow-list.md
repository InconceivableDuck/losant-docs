# Workflow List

The Workflow List block displays a list of workflows within a given application. The list links to each workflow and displays each one's name, enabled / disabled status and a count of runs and errors in the last 24 hours.

## Configuration

The block takes one optional parameter: a filter to reduce the list of workflows by name. The filter accepts an asterisk `*` to search for any occurrence of the given characters in the device name. For example:

* Filtering with "geo" will display a workflow called "Geofence" but hide one called "Park My Geo Prizm"
* Filtering with "\*geo", will show both the "Geofence" and "Park My Geo Prizm" workflows

To display all of your workflows for a given application, do not provide a filter.
