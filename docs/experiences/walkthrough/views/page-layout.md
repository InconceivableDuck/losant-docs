# Part 1 - Page Layout

An Experience View's [Page Layout](/experiences/views/#layouts) holds elements and visuals that are common across all pages in your custom experience. This is typically one of the first things you'll create before building any other pages or components.

For this walkthrough, the Page Layout that we'll be building looks like the following image.

As you can see, this layout includes a header and a footer. The header includes a logo, a few navigation links, and a log in link. The footer includes a copyright statement. The blank space in the middle is where individual pages will be rendered.

The Experience Views functionality can be found under the "Views" tab in the "Experience" section of Losant.
