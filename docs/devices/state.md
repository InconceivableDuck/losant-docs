# Device State

Device state is one of the core communication and data components of the Structure platform. A device's state represents a snapshot of the device at some point in time. For example, if the device has a temperature sensor, it might report the temperature every minute of so. Structure stores every state request and makes them available in visualizations and workflow triggers.
