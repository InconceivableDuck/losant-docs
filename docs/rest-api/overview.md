# Losant REST API

Losant is powered by a full REST API that provides access to nearly every feature. The Losant front-end web application itself is built on top of this API, and so almost all the data and functionality in the front end is available through the API itself.  In fact, the front-end uses the open-source <a href="https://github.com/Losant/losant-rest-js" target="_blank">losant-rest-js</a> JavaScript client to communicate with the Losant API. If JavaScript is not your language of choice, no need to worry! We have easy to use libraries for a number of different languages:

*   JavaScript with <a href="https://github.com/Losant/losant-rest-js" target="_blank">losant-rest-js</a>  
Available in Node Package Manager: `npm install losant-rest`  
<br/>
*   Python with <a href="https://github.com/Losant/losant-rest-python" target="_blank">losant-rest-python</a>  
Available in the Python Package Index: `pip install losant-rest`  
<br/>
*   Ruby with <a href="https://github.com/Losant/losant-rest-ruby" target="_blank">losant-rest-ruby</a>  
Available in RubyGems: `gem install losant_rest`

Of course, if you are working in a language not listed above, the API is reasonably easy to use directly - if your language has a good HTTP request library and a good JSON library, you should be able to make any API request you need to using the documentation here.

All of the documentation and examples here are aimed at making direct HTTP requests against the Losant API, using curl examples whenever possible.  If you plan on using one of the wrapping libraries listed above, the documentation in those repositories will be a much more useful place to learn how to use the particular library.

## API Overview
<small><br/></small>
### Content & Encoding

The Losant API is uses JSON for almost all requests and responses - all request bodies should be JSON encoded, and all responses will be encoded JSON, even in the case of errors.  So every request should have both the `Content-Type` and `Accept` headers set to `application/json`.

### Authenticating a Request

Most endpoints on the Losant API require authenticating as either a user or device.  This is done by passing a Bearer Authorization token in the `Authorization` header field for the request (e.g. `"Authorization": "Bearer your-api-token-goes-here"`).

### Obtaining an Authorization Token

You can obtain an Authorization Token to use to make authenticated requests by calling one of the [Auth](/rest-api/auth/) endpoints.  There are two main endpoints, one for [authenticating as a user](/rest-api/auth/#post-user), and one for [authenticating as a device](/rest-api/auth/#post-device).  The JSON response for either endpoint has a `token` field, which is the authorization token you should use in the Authorization header in subsequent requests that you want to perform as that user or device.

### User-Based Example

The following shows a sequence of curl commands for authenticating as a user and using the resulting token to get a list of devices for an application:

```bash
curl -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -H 'Accept: application/json' \
    -X POST \
    -d '{ "email": "example@losant.com", "password": "your_password" }' \
    https://api.losant.com/auth/user

# Example user authenication result
# {
#   "token": "a user auth token string",
#   "userId": "theUserId"
# }

curl -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -H 'Accept: application/json' \
    -H 'Authorization: Bearer a user auth token string' \
    -X GET \
    https://api.losant.com/applications/anAppId/devices

# Example device listing result
# {
#   "count": 1,
#   "items": [ {
#     "deviceClass": "standalone",
#     "connectionInfo": { "connected": 0, "time": "2016-06-01T17:16:02.324Z" },

#     "attributes": [
#       { "name": "string", "dataType": "string" },
#       { "name": "number", "dataType": "number" },
#       { "name": "boolean", "dataType": "boolean" }
#     ],
#     "description": "",

```

### Device-Based Example

The following shows a sequence of curl commands for authenticating as a device and using the resulting token to publish state as that device:

```bash
curl -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -H 'Accept: application/json' \
    -X POST \
    -d '{ "deviceId": "myDeviceId", "key": "my_app_access_key", "secret": "my_app_access_secret"}' \
    https://api.losant.com/auth/device

# Example device authentication result
# {
#   "applicationId": "myAppId",
#   "token": "a device auth token string",
#   "restricted": false,
#   "deviceId": "myDeviceId",
#   "deviceClass": "standalone"
# }

curl -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -H 'Accept: application/json' \
    -H 'Authorization: Bearer a device auth token string' \
    -X POST \
    -d '{ "data": { "temperature": 68.2 } }' \
    https://api.losant.com/applications/myAppId/devices/myDeviceId/state

# Example device state push result
# { "success": true }
```
