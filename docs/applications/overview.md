# Applications

All [devices](/devices/overview) and [workflows](/workflows/overview) belong to a single application. Users can have multiple applications as needed. [Dashboards](/dashboards/overview) do not belong to an application since a single dashboard can contain graphs and blocks for several different applications.

## Creating Applications

There are a few places within the platform from which an application can be created; or, applications can be created at any time using the main `Applications` menu.

When creating an application, you will be asked for three pieces of information:

-   **Application Name:** You are required to name your new application. The name can be changed at any time.
-   **Description:** Optionally, you may also provide a more detailed description of the application.
-   **Owner:** The application must be scoped to your personal [Sandbox](/user-accounts/sandbox) or to an [organization](/organizations/overview) for which you have the [Editor role](/organizations/members/#member-roles). The owner can be changed at a later date only if you have Administrator permissions for the parent organization (or Sandbox).

## Deleting Applications

Applications can be deleted on the settings page. Deleting an application cannot be undone. All devices, device data, workflows, and device recipes owned by this application will be permanently removed.
