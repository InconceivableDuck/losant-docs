# Applications

All devices and workflows belong to a single application. Users can have multiple applications as needed. [Dashboards](/dashboards/overview) do not belong to an application since a single dashboard can contain graphs and blocks for several different applications.

## Creating Applications

Application can be created at any time using the main `Applications` menu.
