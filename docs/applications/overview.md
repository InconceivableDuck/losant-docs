# Applications

All devices and workflows belong to a single application. Users can have multiple applications as needed. [Dashboards](/dashboards/overview) do not belong to an application since a single dashboard can contain graphs and blocks for several different applications.

## Creating Applications

Application can be created at any time using the main `Applications` menu.

## Application Settings

Applications control all [access keys](/applications/access-keys) and [webhooks](/applications/webhooks). Access keys can control access on a per-device or per-application level. Webhooks are used as [triggers](/workflows/triggers/webhook) on Structure [workflows](/workflows/overview). Please refer to their individual documentation for further details.
