# HTTP Node

The HTTP node allows a workflow to make an arbitrary HTTP request and optionally place the response on the current payload.

## Configuration

The HTTP node can be configured with all the common properties of an HTTP request - request method, request URL, request body, and request headers. In addition, the node can optionally store the response of the request at a spot in the payload.

### Basic Configuration

The first part of configuring the node is selecting the method of the HTTP request - choosing between "GET", "POST", "PUT", and "DELETE". Next is the URL to actually make the request at - this field supports static URLs or [string templates](/workflows/accessing-payload-data/#string-templates). The third basic part of setting up an HTTP node is configuring the body - which is actually not allowed for "GET" and "DELETE" requests. For "POST" and "PUT" requests, however, the body is optional and supports standard [JSON templates](/workflows/accessing-payload-data/#json-templates). In the above example, the node is making a "GET" request to the URL `https://rrtp.comed.com/api?type=5minutefeed`.

### Header Configuration

The HTTP node also has optional support for adding headers to the HTTP request. Each header is a combination of a header name and a header value. Header values can take [string templates](/workflows/accessing-payload-data/#string-templates) to dynamically build headers out of the current payload if needed. The above example has a single header of `User-Agent` whose value is the template `Losant/{{ flowId }}`.

### Storing The Response

![Response Configuration](/images/workflows/data/http-node-response-configuration.png "Response Configuration")

The HTTP node can optionally store the response from the request at an arbitrary [payload path](/workflows/accessing-payload-data/#payload-paths). If a path is defined, the body, headers, and status code are stored at the given path. The node also attempts to parse the body as JSON - if it is parseable, the parsed object is placed on the payload instead of the raw response body string. In the example above, the response will be stored at the `data.pricing` field.

So with the above example, given the following payload:

```json
{
  "time": Fri Feb 19 2016 17:26:00 GMT-0500 (EST),
  "data": {},
  "applicationId": "568beedeb436ab01007be53d",
  "applicationName": "Embree"
  "triggerId": "f6094780d98111e5883a37908659487f",
  "triggerType": "timer",
  "flowId": "568dcdee86985501006360ba",
  "flowName": "Electricity Pricing Data",
  "globals": { }
}
```

The node will make a GET request to `https://rrtp.comed.com/api?type=5minutefeed` with no body, but with the header `User-Agent` set to `Losant/568dcdee86985501006360ba`. When the request responds, the workflow will continue with the response on the payload in `data.pricing`, potentially looking like:

```json
{
  "time": Fri Feb 19 2016 17:26:00 GMT-0500 (EST),
  "data": {
    "pricing": {
      "body": [
        {
          "millisUTC": "1456158300000",
          "price": "2.5"
        },
        {
          "millisUTC": "1456158000000",
          "price": "2.5"
        },
        ...
      ],
      "headers": {
        "strict-transport-security": "max-age=15768000",
        "content-type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8",
        "connection": "close",
        "transfer-encoding": "chunked"
      },
      "statusCode": 200
    }
  },
  "applicationId": "568beedeb436ab01007be53d",
  "applicationName": "Embree",
  "triggerId": "f6094780d98111e5883a37908659487f",
  "triggerType": "timer",
  "flowId": "568dcdee86985501006360ba",
  "flowName": "Electricity Pricing Data",
  "globals": { }
}
```
