# Get Device Node

The get device node allows a workflow to retrieve one or more [devices](/devices/overview/) from the current application and add them to the current workflow payload.

## Configuration

There are two ways to query for devices using this node - by device id, or by tags. When querying by device id, the configuration expects a single device id, which is [templatable](/workflows/accessing-payload-data/#string-templates) and so can be pulled off of the current workflow payload. When querying by device tags, the configuration expects one or more tag key/value pairs, and *all* of the pairs have to match the device in order for the device to be returned by the query. The same rules apply here that apply to tag queries in the rest of Losant - if a key is provided but no value, any device with that tag key will match (and value will not matter), and if a value is provided but no key, any device with that tag value will match (and key will not matter). The key and value fields here are [templatable](/workflows/accessing-payload-data/#string-templates) as well.

When querying by tags, you also have the option of just returning the first device match (if you know that there should only be a single device), or return an array of devices that match. For querying by device id, there will at most be a single device that matches, so the return will never be an array.

The query result will be stored at the [payload path](/workflows/accessing-payload-data/#payload-paths) provided in the `Result Path` field. If the query is configured to potentially return multiple results, this will always be an array, even if no results are found. If the query is only returning a single result, this will either be the device object or will be `null`. In addition, you have the option of changing the form of the tags on the device result. By default it is the standard array of key/value pairs (the same as the Losant API returns) - but you can instead ask for the tags to be in the form of an object map, where the tags property will be an object. In that case, each tag key will be a property on the object, and the value of that property will be an array of all the tag values for that key on the device. This is often an easier form to work with inside of workflows.

In the example above, the workflow will retrieve the device that has the `sigfox_id` tag matching the value at `data.body.device` on the payload. It is only expecting a single device to be returned, and will place the resulting device at `data.losantDevice` with the tags in object form.  For example, the payload after the Get Device node runs might look like the following:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "body": {
      "device": "AA00FF",
      ...
    },
    "losantDevice": {
      "id": "56c794a06895b00100cbe84c",
      "name": "Sigfox Device",
      "deviceClass": "standalone",
      "tags": {
        "sigfox_id": ["AA00FF"]
      },
      "attributes": [
        { "name": "temp", "dataType": "number" }
      ],
      ...
    },
    ...
  },
  ...
}
```
