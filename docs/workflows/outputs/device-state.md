# Device State Node

The device state node allows a workflow to update the state of a [device](/devices/overview/#device-configuration).

## Configuration

There are two parts to configuring a device state node - selecting the device that the node should set the state of, and configuring what attributes and values should be set as the state.

Any number of attributes can be configured - it does not have to be all of the attributes that the device is configured for.  Attribute values support templating, and so can pull values off of the currently executing workflow payload.  Values will be cast (if possible) to the type of attribute that the device has been previously defined to expect.

In the above example, the device state node is setting the state of the device `Electricity Cost`.  It will set the `cents` attribute to the value of the field `data.pricing.price` in the current payload.
