# Edge Workflows

TBD maybe this is just a section of the workflow overview? cloud vs edge?

## Saving and Deploying

Workflows are saved and deployed using the `Deploy Workflow` button.

The button will be green whenever there are changes that can be deployed. It will be gray when there are no changes. If you are viewing a [workflow version](/workflows/versioning/), the button will not allow the deployment of any changes; instead, it will allow you to return to the Develop version.

Workflows can be enabled and disabled by clicking the `Enabled` checkbox on the workflow settings panel, and then clicking the "Update" button. The workflow settings panel can be displayed by clicking the gear icon in the right dock.

Once a workflow has been deployed, its changes will take effect immediately.
