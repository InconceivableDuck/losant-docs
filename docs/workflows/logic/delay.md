# Delay Node

The delay node allows a workflow to pause for a short time before continuing.

## Configuration

The delay node has a single configuration value, which is the number of seconds that the node should pause the currently executing workflow for. The number of seconds can be anywhere between 0 seconds (no pause) and 60 seconds. Pauses longer than 60 seconds are not allowed, because the maximum execution time of a workflow is limited to 60 seconds.

In the above example, the workflow will delay for 30 seconds between the "Device Turn On" command node and the "Device Turn Off" command node.
