# MQTT Trigger

The MQTT trigger will trigger a workflow whenever a message is sent to the configured topic on the Structure MQTT Broker.

## Configuration

The only configuration needed for this node is the topic name to trigger on.  The node supports valid MQTT topic names.  The topic is not allowed to be a wildcard topic, a MQTT system topic, or a Structure specific topic.

In the above example, the workflow will be triggered whenever any message is published on the MQTT topic "legacy/commands".

## Payload

The payload will include the payload of the MQTT message on the `data` field, as well as the standard workflow payload information.  Unlike most other triggers, where the value of the `data` field is an object, the value of `data` for the MQTT trigger will be a string.  In the general case, a MQTT workflow payload will look like the following:

```json
{
  "time": <time of the event>,
  "data": <the mqtt message payload, as a string>,
  "applicationId": <id of the current application>,
  "triggerId": <id of the workflow trigger>,
  "triggerType": "mqttTopic",
  "flowId": <id of the current workflow>
}
```

For the example workflow above, a specific payload for a triggered workflow might look like this:

```json
{
  "time": Fri Feb 19 2016 17:26:00 GMT-0500 (EST),
  "data": "machineOn",
  "applicationId": "568beedeb436ab01007be53d",
  "triggerId": "legacy/commands",
  "triggerType": "mqttTopic",
  "flowId": "56c74add04d0b50100043381"
}
```
