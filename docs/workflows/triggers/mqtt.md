# MQTT Trigger

The MQTT trigger will trigger a workflow whenever a message is sent to one of your [MQTT broker integrations](/applications/integrations/#mqtt), or to a topic of your choosing on the [Losant MQTT broker](/mqtt/overview/#the-losant-message-broker).

## Configuration

When setting up the trigger, you must first choose an MQTT broker. If you select one of your [MQTT broker integrations](/applications/integrations/#mqtt), the workflow will trigger anytime a message is received on one of the integration's configured topics.

You may set up the trigger to work with the default Losant MQTT broker. When doing so, you must also define a single topic on which the workflow should trigger when a message is published to that topic. This must be a [valid MQTT topic](http://www.hivemq.com/blog/mqtt-essentials-part-5-mqtt-topics-best-practices), and furthermore, it cannot be a wildcard topic, an MQTT system topic or a Losant-specific topic.

In the above example, the workflow will trigger whenever any message is published to the Losant broker on the MQTT topic "alerts/power".

## Payload

The payload will include the payload of the MQTT message on the `data` field, as well as the standard workflow payload information. The `triggerType` will be "mqttTopic" when using the Losant broker, and "subscription" when using one of your integrations.

Unlike most other triggers, where the value of the `data` field is an object, the value of `data` for the MQTT trigger will be a string. In the general case, an MQTT workflow payload will look like the following:

```json
{
  "time": <time of the message>,
  "data": <the mqtt message payload, as a string>,
  "applicationId": <id of the current application>,
  "applicationName": <name of the current application>,
  "triggerId": <id of the mqtt trigger>,
  "triggerType": "mqttTopic",
  "flowId": <id of the current workflow>,
  "flowName": <name of the current workflow>,
  "globals": <object of workflow globals>
}
```

For the example workflow above, a specific payload for a triggered workflow might look like this:

```json
{
  "time": Fri Feb 19 2016 17:26:00 GMT-0500 (EST),
  "data": "machineOn",
  "applicationId": "568beedeb436ab01007be53d",
  "applicationName": "Embree",
  "triggerId": "alerts/power",
  "triggerType": "mqttTopic",
  "flowId": "56c74add04d0b50100043381",
  "flowName": "Power Usage Alert",
  "globals": {}
}
```
